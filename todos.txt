prepare_train:
    -> saving weights (last or best)✅
    -> specifying train method (how train files are being passed - randomly/ one after another, etc.)✅

prepare_dataset module:
    -> read dataset from file/files/train_test_files
    -> obtaining multivariate timeseries🟠

weight_optimization:
    -> other methods of optimization
    -> optional aggregation weights optimization✅
    -> make passing window transformation function optional

util/data_prep:
    -> different rescaling limits✅
    -> read from arffs (using read_file module)✅
    -> add rescaling to data read from arff✅
    -> add support for rescaling limits for arff files
    -> get test files from different class✅

preprocessing/read_file:
    -> read dimensions from different files OR 
    -> from one file✅
    -> specify class type✅

testing:
    -> modify code to perform testing on arff data✅
    -> calculate errors✅

main:
    -> saving results✅
    -> universal file naming✅
    -> passing dimensions of timeseries as a parameter✅

-> passing files as ranges (23-34: means files 23,24,25,...,34)✅
-> prompting values from user✅
-> get this module ready to perform our previous calculations✅

input file with parameters:
    -> dataset tr/te paths✅
        -> method of passing files (specific files, random✅, crossval🟠) (tr and te)
        -> class of training files
    -> classifier type✅
        -> specific parameters to classifier
    -> output path✅
    -> script for generating input files✅

util/results_aggregation:
    -> perform results aggregation based on resulting .json files✅


models/image_recognition:
    -> create modular CNN
    -> return specific .json with results of each prediction

results_aggregation/classification_score:
    -> create universal model voting for class predictions

-> using same train files for different classes (for random and crossval)🟠
-> early stopping
-> get rid of nans
